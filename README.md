# Predicting the statistics of COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam using Machine Learning and Mathematical Models

## *Courtesy of Vietnam Ministry of Health*

### Introduction

On March 21st, a group of specialist teams in modelling and predicting the outbreak of COVID-19 in Vietnam is founded, under the management of the Vietnam ministry of health (MOH). This group consists of specialists working around the world in different fields, including medicine, epidemiology, pharmacy, computer science, mathematics, etc. Its purpose is to provide meaningful models and insight results in assisting officials on applying suitable policies to control the outbreak.

### Team members

The team members include:

- NGO Hoang Anh:
    - Department of Mathematics and Department of Economics, Ã‰cole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France
    - Email: hoang-anh.ngo@polytechnique.edu
- HOANG Thai Nam:
    - Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Beloit College, USA
    - Email: hoangnt@beloit.edu
- NGUYEN Tuan Khoi
    - Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia
    - Email: tuankhoin@student.unimelb.edu.au

This project is under the supervision of Dr. HA Anh Duc (The Ministry of Health Office), and Dr. NGUYEN Thu Anh (The University of Sydney and Woolcock Institute of Medical Research) serves as the epidemiological supervior and data provider for the group.
